## What is this organization about?
This organization will mostly house the compositor, widgets and some related libraries, modules and wrappers mostly written in Nim and hence the name. I aim to learn about wayland protocols and wayland compositors.

## Goals
* To be easy to use and configure.
* Come with an extensible bar, yet be compatible with 3rd-party bars.
* To be extensible in the form of widgets, applets or extensions.

## Configuration(TBD)
I aim to have it configurable in one of these options:
* YAML
* TOML
* XML
* Nim itself.
